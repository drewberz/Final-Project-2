PATH TRACING EXPERIMENT:
Starting from a dot in the middle of the screen, a participant traces a straight line to a target on the screen using the mousepad.
Initially, the cursor responds normally, but in later it adjusts the path slightly in one direction.
We want to test if peopleâ€™s brains adjust for this automatically without being aware that an adjustment has been made.

We have multiple python files that were created as we restarted several times and had trouble with GitHub. 
Our Final Experiment is Real_Final_Experiment

We ran this experiment on PsychoPy
The code should import any libraries necessary. We used numpy, pandas

The data outputs as a .csv file named by the autogenerated participant number. This needs to be manually uploaded to our CoLab Notebook and several lines
in the notebook need to be edited with every new participant added. There is already several data file uploaded to our CoLab notebook, so it should not 
be necessary to add more.
